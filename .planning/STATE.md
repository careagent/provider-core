# Session State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

## Position

**Milestone:** v1.0 milestone
**Current phase:** 06-documentation-and-release
**Current Plan:** Not started
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Progress:** [██████████] 100%

## Decisions

- Pass undefined to detectPlatform in standalone (returns 'standalone' for non-object input)
- Chart-skill instructions only registered when chart-skill is among loaded skills
- Skill cache write uses inner try/catch so failures never abort skill loading
- refinement.observe session-start fires on every agent bootstrap regardless of loaded skills
- [Phase 07]: Show 'Not loaded in this session' when skill cache absent in active state
- [Phase 07]: Show 'Clinical Skills (last session)' in inactive state only when cache exists from prior session
- [Phase 08]: Profile kept optional in registerCLI to avoid breaking existing test call sites
- [Phase 08]: Profile added as required field on ActivateResult since it is always determinable
- [Phase 08]: Agents-standard auto-detection formally deferred per research Option D
- [Phase 06]: Architecture guide uses 3 Mermaid diagrams: ecosystem overview, activation flow, hardening pipeline
- [Phase 06]: Installation guide documents all 4 package entry points (default, openclaw, standalone, core)
- [Phase 06]: order-skill and charge-skill mentioned only as planned future features, not functional
- [Phase 06]: Single configuration.md for CANS schema, skill manifest, and plugin config (combined ~280 lines)
- [Phase 06]: Workspace files table migrated from README to onboarding.md
- [Phase 06]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md links to Contributor Covenant 2.1 rather than reproducing full text
- [Phase 06]: README slimmed from 355 to 77 lines as overview hub linking to docs/
