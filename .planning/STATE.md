# State: CareAgent

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** A provider installs CareAgent into OpenClaw, completes an onboarding interview, and interacts with a personalized clinical agent that knows their specialty, speaks in their clinical voice, respects their scope boundaries, and logs every action to an immutable audit trail.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 executing. Plans 01-04 complete, Plan 05 next.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 - Plugin Foundation, Clinical Activation, and Audit Pipeline
**Plan:** 05 (next to execute)
**Status:** Executing
**Progress:** [####......] 4/6 plans

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 6-phase roadmap derived from requirement dependencies | Roadmap | Natural delivery boundaries: skeleton -> onboarding -> hardening -> skills -> integration -> docs |
| Phase 1 combines PLUG + CANS + AUDT | Roadmap | These three components are deeply interdependent -- audit logs CANS activation, plugin registers both |
| Phase 5 separates integration from documentation | Roadmap | Comprehensive depth; integration validates the system, docs describe the validated system |
| Hardening before skills (Phase 3 before Phase 4) | Roadmap | Research finding: clinical skills must never load into an unhardened environment |
| 6 plans in 5 waves for Phase 1 | Planning | Wave 3 parallelizes activation gate and audit pipeline (independent subsystems) |
| Vendor yaml package via tsdown bundling | Planning | Zero-dep constraint + YAML 1.2 avoids Norway problem. yaml package is ISC, zero deps itself |
| Adapter layer from day one | Planning | OpenClaw releases daily with breaking changes. Adapter insulates all CareAgent code |
| Hash chaining from first audit entry | Planning | Research + pitfall analysis: deferring hash chains is the #1 audit integrity mistake |
| tsdown outExtensions for .js/.d.ts output | 1-01 | tsdown 0.20 defaults to .mjs/.d.mts; explicit outExtensions ensures package.json exports match |
| Every OpenClaw API call wrapped in try/catch | 1-02 | Graceful degradation prevents plugin crashes when OpenClaw API changes |
| 3-level workspace path fallback | 1-02 | Different OpenClaw versions expose workspace path at different locations on the API object |
| clinical_voice Optional, all other CANS root sections required | 1-02 | Clinical voice populated during onboarding (Phase 2); other sections required for activation |
| Union of Literals for license type in TypeBox | 1-02 | String enums would allow any string at runtime; literals enforce exact match |
| Vendored yaml via src/vendor/yaml/index.ts | 1-03 | Centralized and replaceable YAML parsing; bundled by tsdown, not external |
| First-load trust model for integrity checking | 1-03 | First verifyIntegrity call stores hash; subsequent calls compare against stored value |
| AuditCallback injection decouples gate from pipeline | 1-03 | ActivationGate accepts callback at construction, avoiding circular dependency with audit |
| Zero runtime dependencies for audit subsystem | 1-04 | Uses only node:fs and node:crypto built-ins, honoring the zero-dep constraint |
| Hash chaining from genesis entry (prev_hash: null) | 1-04 | Research finding: deferring hash chains is the #1 audit integrity mistake |
| Spread-conditional pattern for optional fields | 1-04 | Prevents undefined values from appearing in JSON serialization |
| Audit log stored in .careagent/AUDIT.log | 1-04 | Standard workspace subdirectory, created automatically with recursive mkdir |

### Research Findings Applied

- Five-phase structure from research expanded to six (split integration/docs for comprehensive depth)
- Hash chaining from day one (AUDT-04 in Phase 1, not deferred)
- Adapter layer in Phase 1 (PLUG-04) per pitfall prevention
- before_tool_call canary test (HARD-07) as explicit requirement
- Template-constrained generation for chart-skill (SKIL-05) per hallucination prevention
- YAML 1.2 default avoids implicit type coercion (Pitfall 2)
- Session-scoped audit chains allow concurrent sessions

### TODOs

- None yet

### Blockers

- None yet

## Session Continuity

### Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Activity:** Phase 1 Plan 03 execution
- **Completed:** 1-03-SUMMARY.md -- CANS parser, activation gate, integrity check, 34 new tests (87 total)
- **Next:** Execute Phase 1 Plan 04 (audit pipeline) if not already done in parallel, then Plan 05

### Context for Next Session
- Plans 01-03 complete: scaffold + adapter + types + CANS schema + parser + integrity + gate
- Activation subsystem complete: parseFrontmatter, verifyIntegrity, ActivationGate
- ActivationGate at src/activation/gate.ts (four-step: presence, parse, validate, integrity)
- AuditCallback type at src/activation/gate.ts for dependency injection
- Vendored YAML at src/vendor/yaml/index.ts (bundled by tsdown)
- Test fixtures: valid-cans.md, malformed-cans.md, tampered-cans.md
- Plan 04 (Wave 3): Audit pipeline (may already be complete from parallel execution)
- Plan 05 (Wave 4): Wire register() + integrity service
- Plan 06 (Wave 5): Integration tests + verification
- VPS-only development -- never install on local OpenClaw
- Zero runtime npm dependencies constraint
- TypeBox for all schemas (not Zod)
