<objective>
Create open-source release artifacts and slim down README to an overview hub.

Purpose: This plan prepares the repository for public open-source release. CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and GitHub templates establish community infrastructure. The README slim-down replaces the current detailed README with a concise hub that links to the docs/ guides created in Plans 01 and 02.

Output: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, updated `README.md`

Create all open-source community health files:

**CONTRIBUTING.md** — Minimal essentials per user decision. Structure:
1. Brief welcome paragraph
2. **Development Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/careagent/provider-core
   cd provider-core
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Running Tests**: `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:coverage`
4. **Submitting a Pull Request**: Fork, branch, make changes, run tests, submit PR. Link to docs/installation.md for comprehensive setup if needed.
5. **Code Conventions**: TypeScript ESM, Node.js >= 22.12.0, pnpm, vitest for testing, no runtime npm dependencies.
6. **Clinical Skills**: Direct contributors to [careagent/provider-skills](https://github.com/careagent/provider-skills) for clinical skill contributions.
7. **Important**: No real patient data or PHI in code, tests, or documentation. Synthetic data only.

Keep under ~80 lines total. Short and practical.

**CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant 2.1 standard text verbatim. Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` with: "Report to project maintainers via GitHub Issues with the `conduct` label." Attribution to Contributor Covenant at the bottom.

**`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`** — YAML issue form (not markdown template). Use the structure from 06-RESEARCH.md Code Examples section:
- Description (textarea, required)
- Steps to Reproduce (textarea, required)
- Expected Behavior (textarea, required)
- Version (input, required)
- Node.js Version (input, required)
- Operating System (input, required)
- Labels: ["bug"]
- Title prefix: "[Bug]: "

**`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`** — YAML issue form:
- Feature Description (textarea, required): What feature would you like?
- Use Case (textarea, required): Why is this needed?
- Alternatives Considered (textarea, optional)
- Additional Context (textarea, optional)
- Labels: ["enhancement"]
- Title prefix: "[Feature]: "

**`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`** — Template chooser:
```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: true
contact_links: []
```

**`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** — Use the structure from 06-RESEARCH.md:
- Summary section
- Changes section
- Testing section with `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` checkboxes
- Checklist: code conventions, documentation updated, no PHI
  </action>
  <verify>
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists, under ~80 lines, contains `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` exists, contains "Contributor Covenant" and "Version 2.1"
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` exists, is valid YAML issue form
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` exists, is valid YAML issue form
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` exists with `blank_issues_enabled: true`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` exists with checklist
  </verify>
  <done>
All community health files exist: CONTRIBUTING.md (minimal, practical), CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1), GitHub issue templates (YAML forms for bugs and features), and PR template. Repository meets GitHub community health standards.

  <name>Task 2: Slim down README.md to overview hub</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `README.md` as a slim overview hub that links to docs/ for detail. The current README is ~355 lines of detailed content that has been migrated to docs/ guides. The new README should be a concise entry point.

Structure of the new slim README:

1. **Title and tagline** — `# @careagent/provider-core` followed by one bold tagline: "The provider-side CareAgent plugin for OpenClaw."

2. **Description** — 2-3 paragraph overview of what this package does. Keep the strong opening from the current README ("transforms a standard OpenClaw personal AI agent into a credentialed, auditable, hardened clinical agent governed by the Irreducible Risk Hypothesis"). Condense "What This Package Does" into the key points without full detail.

3. **The Seven Atomic Actions** — Keep a condensed version of this section. It is a defining concept for the project (per research recommendation). Keep the table and a brief intro paragraph. Remove the detailed per-action multi-paragraph explanations — leave just the table and a summary sentence about what @careagent/provider-core enables.

4. **Quick Start** — Brief install snippet:
   ```bash
   openclaw plugins install @careagent/provider-core
   openclaw gateway restart
   careagent init
   ```
   Then: "See [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for full setup instructions."

5. **Documentation** — Links table:
   | Guide | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Plugin model, CANS activation, hardening, skills, audit |
   | [Installation](docs/installation.md) | Prerequisites, setup, first-run verification |
   | [Onboarding](docs/onboarding.md) | Provider interview and CANS.md generation |
   | [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) | CANS.md schema, skill manifests, plugin config |

6. **Related Repositories** — Keep the existing table linking to careagent/patient-core, careagent/neuron, careagent/axon, etc.

7. **Contributing** — Two sentences: "Contributions welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and guidelines."

8. **License** — "Apache 2.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE)." Keep the existing closing statement about transparency.

Do NOT include in the slim README:
- Architecture section (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Detailed hardening section (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Clinical Skills detail (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Audit Logging detail (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- CANS description (migrated to docs/architecture.md + docs/configuration.md)
- Full onboarding description (migrated to docs/onboarding.md)
- Workspace After Onboarding table (migrated to docs/onboarding.md)
- Local Development section (migrated to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Repository Structure (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- CLI Commands detail (covered in docs/onboarding.md)
- Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent Mode (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Neuron Integration detail (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Cross-Installation Protocol detail (migrated to docs/architecture.md)
- Continuous Improvement detail (brief mention is fine, link to docs/)
- Ecosystem ASCII diagram (converted to Mermaid in docs/architecture.md)

After writing the new README, do a link audit: verify every `](...)` reference points to a file that exists (docs/architecture.md, docs/installation.md, docs/onboarding.md, docs/configuration.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE).
  </action>
  <verify>
- `README.md` is significantly shorter than the original (~355 lines -> target ~100-130 lines)
- Contains links to all four docs/ guides
- Contains link to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Contains the Seven Atomic Actions table (condensed)
- Contains Quick Start install snippet
- Contains Related Repositories table
- Does NOT contain: detailed architecture section, hardening layers detail, clinical skills detail, audit logging detail, workspace table, local development, repository structure, ecosystem ASCII diagram
- All links resolve to existing files
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md is a slim overview hub (~100-130 lines) with project identity, Seven Atomic Actions table, quick start, documentation links, related repositories, and license. All detailed content lives in docs/ guides. A visitor sees the project identity immediately and can navigate to depth via links.
  </done>

<verification>
- All community health files exist: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- LICENSE already exists (Apache 2.0) — verified not duplicated
- README.md is a slim hub linking to docs/
- All cross-document links resolve to existing files (audit all `](` references)
- No orphaned content — everything that was in the README either lives in docs/ or was deliberately cut
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The repository is open-source ready: README gives a clear first impression, docs/ provides depth, community health files set contribution expectations, and GitHub templates guide issue reporting and PR submission. A new visitor can understand the project in 2 minutes from the README and dive deeper via linked guides.
