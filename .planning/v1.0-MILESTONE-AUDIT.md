## Integration Checker Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring (52/52 connected)

| From | To | Connection | Status |
|------|----|-----------|--------|
| Phase 01 (CANS.md) | Phase 03 (hardening) | ActivationGate → createHardeningEngine({cans}) | **WIRED** |
| Phase 01 (audit) | All phases | Single AuditPipeline passed by reference | **WIRED** |
| Phase 03 (hardening) | Phase 04 (skills) | engine.activate() before loadClinicalSkills() | **WIRED** |
| Phase 04 (skills) | Phase 07 (wiring) | buildChartSkillInstructions() after loadClinicalSkills() | **WIRED** |
| Phase 05 (refinement) | Phase 07 (wiring) | refinement.observe() via onAgentBootstrap | **WIRED** |
| Phase 06 (docs) | Phases 1-5, 7-8 | All source file references resolve, schema cross-checks match | **WIRED** |
| Phase 07 (skill cache) | Phase 02 (status) | writeFileSync → readSkillCache() → formatStatus() | **WIRED** |
| Phase 07 (detectPlatform) | Phase 08 (profile) | detectPlatform → getWorkspaceProfile → registerCLI → supplementation | **WIRED** |
| Entry points | All components | openclaw.ts, standalone.ts, core.ts wire all components | **WIRED** |

### Integration Gaps (3 — all by design)

| # | Gap | Severity | Affected Requirements |
|---|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Standalone adapter onAgentBootstrap is a no-op | Info (by design) | CANS-08, SKIL-05/06, HARD-03 |
| 2 | Standalone adapter has no CLI surface | Info (by design) | ONBD-01, ONBD-04 |
| 3 | Standalone mode: no audit integrity service | Info (adapter no-op) | AUDT-06 |

All three gaps are documented architectural decisions — standalone mode is a library API where the host is responsible for CLI and event surfaces.

### E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fresh install → register → activate → hardening → skills → audit | **Complete** | Phase 05 INTG-01 |
| Onboarding → interview → CANS.md → workspace supplementation | **Complete** | Phase 02 + Phase 08 profile wiring |
| Hardening → 4-layer check → audit logging | **Complete** | Phase 03 + Phase 05 security review |
| Skill loading → credential gate → integrity → chart-skill injection | **Complete** | Phase 04 + Phase 07 wiring |
| CANS continuous improvement → observe → propose → resolve → update | **Complete** | Phase 05 + Phase 07 wiring |
| Documentation → install → onboard → first clinical interaction | **Complete** | Phase 06 (INTG-03 now satisfiable) |

**All 6 E2E flows complete**

---

## Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 52 requirements in the REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table are assigned to phases and appear in at least one phase's VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md frontmatter, or integration test coverage.

---

## Documentation Findings (Phase 6 — Informational)

From integration checker, 4 informational findings — none are blockers:

1. **`docs/architecture.md` adapters/ directory comment** references `agents-standard` subdirectory that doesn't exist yet (deferred to future phase). May cause developer confusion.
2. **Activation flow Mermaid diagram** is a conceptual simplification — omits audit pipeline initialization order and refinement engine from the sequence. Not incorrect, but incomplete.
3. **Audit entry field table** in `docs/architecture.md` omits 3 optional fields (`target`, `blocked_reason`, `blocking_layer`). Primary fields are documented.
4. **`docs/onboarding.md` workspace table** shows bare `AUDIT.log` without `.careagent/` prefix. Correct path documented in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Tech Debt Summary

| Category | Items | Count |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Missing phase verifications (01, 02, 04) | 27 requirements lack formal VERIFICATION.md | 3 |
| Stub modules (neuron, protocol) | Exported but not implemented — v2 scope | 2 |
| Docker sandbox report-only | Layer 4 never blocks — intentional for v1.0 | 1 |
| safety_guard CANS flag unused | Flag declared but engine always registers hook | 1 |
| AUDT-03 ai-proposed state | Defined but never emitted (no agentic loop in v1) | 1 |
| PLUG-02 manifest arrays empty | commands/hooks register programmatically, not in manifest | 1 |
| agents-standard auto-detection | Deferred per Phase 8 research Option D; documented extension point | 1 |
| Live host verification needed | CANS-08, SKIL-05/06 onAgentBootstrap in OpenClaw | 1 |
| Standalone bootstrap/CLI no-ops | CLI and bootstrap features are OpenClaw-only by design | 1 |
| Standalone audit integrity | createAuditIntegrityService not wired (adapter no-op) | 1 |
| Doc accuracy (informational) | 4 minor items in Phase 6 documentation (see findings) | 4 |

**Total: 17 items across 11 categories** (0 blockers)
